  <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/json/video_games/">I'm doing the CORGIS on video games</a>
  <p>the dataset has info on game relesed from 2004 to 2010 and contains info on how long it takes to finish a game and if a person beat the game fast, slow or about evenly and if the person fully competed the game, only the main story, main story plus some extres and the time for thosos. it also say the ESRB rating, and the publisher. it does have missing info because I don't think it has every game from that time on it.</p>
	<p>My question was how were the video games being sorted and I found the answer just though looking though it and noticing the pater of the year of release.</p>
